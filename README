Simple post -> comment application on ruby on rails.

The database is on mongoDB.

There is an an file called data.json in main folder, it contains test data to upload to your mongo database.

Use this command:

mongoimport --drop -d lwasak -c fortunes data.json


Application uses gems:

-- simple_form (I will change it to formtastic)
-- kaminari
-- mongoid

-- devise
